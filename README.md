# Improved 3D Tutorial

This program serves to demonstrate what a basic 3D OpenGL program looks like and builds off of the [Standard 3D tutorial](https://github.com/igme-rit/standard-3d-tutorial).

# About

Renders a 3D cube, spinning about the X-Y axis. This uses a uniform Model-View-Projection matrix which allows us to change the perspective of the camera. It also contains an element buffer which is used to read from the vertex buffer. This project is more about getting started and understanding what a basic OpenGL program looks like.

# Setup

In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor. Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
